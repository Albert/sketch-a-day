Today's prompt (oblique strategy):
What mistakes did you make last time?

I initially wanted a big random array of floating 3d traingles w/ pretty directional lighting.  Didn't find it immediately and found this instead : )

No background to reveal all the previous mistakes, I guess is the feeling.  The weird squeezy aspect also seems to heighten need for resolution.  Wow, that's an artsy sentence if I've ever heard one.
