Oblique strategy:  Decorate Decorate

If I were a better coder I would have made a recursive function, but instead I copied / pasted in the interest of time.

I initially wanted to grow inward instead of outward... I basically wanted to draw a circle, and then draw circles on the interior of it while masking the part of the shape that was outside the circle.  Couldn't figure out masking quickly enough, so I just decided to go with this instead.

I realized that a big stroke goes a long way to totally change a sketch's feeling.
