A sketch a day
==============

Uh, I just wanted to start doing a sketch every day.

A "sketch" is some bit of code that just does something interesting.

"Every Day" is, uhm, hopefully every day...


Each sketch comes with a readme.  Sometimes I refer to "oblique strategies" as a seed of inspiration.  I use this tool to get those:
