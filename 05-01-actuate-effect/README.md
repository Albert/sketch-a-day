Things I learned:

Java ArrayList<int> isn't supported.  I remember reading this a long time ago but just ran into it right now.  I guess I need to make a class that just has an <int> public member and I didn't want to...  Instead I used ArrayList<string> for one version (where the size of the array was variable) and then decided against it and just went making the size of the "tags" variable be defined so I could go with int[]

I should learn P5.js instead.
