Oblique Strategy - A very small object - its center

Not much to say bout the sketch.  Figured arrows could help identify the small obj and can insinuate the center / pivot point of it.


Today I decided to go with a p5js solution.  It's not too much more work, but enough to make me roll my eyes when compared to vanilla processing:

Processing
make a folder
name a file in the folder the same name + .pde
void setup() and void draw()

p5js
make an index.html and fill it with content
add styles
get & reference p5js
make and reference script.js
function setup() and function draw()

Next time I think I'll just copy paste... altho bower may have been a bit overkill...
