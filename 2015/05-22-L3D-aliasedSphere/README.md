This if for the L3D project.  More info can be found at cubetube.org.

This is a sphere with some edge blurring.  Quite pleased with the result if I do say so myself!  I'm on the train right now but I am interested to look up the distance functions for capsules and see if I can get good anti-aliased lines.

I coded this on the train and am interested to see what it looks like in person.

I'm also really surprised at how fast it is given how many computations it's making (trig on Java)-- but I guess it's only 512 px.
